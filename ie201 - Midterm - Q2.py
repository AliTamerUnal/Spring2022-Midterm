"""
	(25 points)

	Write a recursive function such that, given a list of intergers (say v) and an integer value (say x), the function returns true if
	there is a subset of intergers in v that sum up to x. Otherwise the function returns false;

	Also write a sample code that runs this function using an example list and value x, and state the expected result.
